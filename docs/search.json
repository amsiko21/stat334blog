    "text": "Intro: The data set I’m working with this week is from Historical Valentine’s Day spending from the years 2010 to 2022. On the tidyTuesday github repository, they state “The National Retail Federation in the United States conducts surveys and has created a Valentine’s Day Data Center so you can explore the data on how consumers celebrate.” This data set includes 13 rows for each year.\nI will be exploring by year, the percent of people celebrating Valentines day and if that has changed throughout the years, and also if there is a trend in average spending in total for each year. I may also explore the trend in one of the specific items like flowers, evening out or jewelry just to see how pries have gone up over time on goods. One important thing to note is that the data collected is averages and doesn’t show much variability because of that, so my results are subjective and generalized.\nThe variables I’m most interested in are:\nYear: Year between 2010 and 2022\nPercentCelebrating: Percent of people celebrating Valentines Day\nPerPerson: Average amount each person is spending\n(Later decided) EveningOut: Average amount of money spent on evenings out\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\n\nhistorical_spending1 &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data/historical_spending.csv\"))\n\n#Visualizing Overall trend in Celebration\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nggplot(data = historical_spending1, aes(x = Year,\n                                       y = PercentCelebrating)) +\n  geom_line(colour = \"magenta\") +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"pink\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(colour = \"pink4\", size = rel(1))) +\n  labs(title = \"Valentines Day Celebration\",\n       y = \"Percent Celebrating\")\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see from this plot, the percent of people celebrating Valentine’s Day based on data collected from the National Retail Federation has gone down since 2010, especially around the end of 2012 to 2014 where we see the percentage take a significant drop to below 55%, and furthermore the poin in 2019 drops to below 50%.\n\nggplot(historical_spending1, aes(x = Year, y = PerPerson)) +\n  geom_line(colour = \"purple\") +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"lavender\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(colour = \"purple4\", size = rel(1))) +\n  labs(title = \"Spending Per Person Over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Average Spending Per Person\")\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we did see an overall decrease in percent of people celebrating Valentine’s Day, we see an overall increase in average spending per person per year, and a spike in the year 2020. This information leads me to assumptions based on the data observed. First, inflation obviously has caused an increase in prices of commercial goods and services throughout time, so we see an increase in spending even though there has been a decrease in celebrating because everything is just more expensive in general. Another noted point is the spike at year 2020 leads me to think back to my Covid days, when holiday celebrations were no longer in person. This leads me to conclude that expressing your love for someone by mailing them or bringing them something makes up for not being able to see them in person, and online purchasing became very popular at this time influencing an increase in spending in general.\n\nggplot(data = historical_spending1, aes(x = Year,\n                                       y = EveningOut)) +\n  geom_line(colour = \"blue\") +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"lightblue\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(colour = \"darkblue\", size = rel(1))) +\n  labs(title = \"Historical Evening Out Spending\",\n       y = \"Average Spent on Evening Out\") \n\n\n\n\nAfter seeing that in 2020 the average spending per person spiked, I mentioned that this was probably because online shopping became very popular during that year because of Covid. This made me curious about the EveningOut variable, because as we know during Covid doing anything outside of the house in public was not popular and advised against especially in early stages in 2020. The plot above shows similar results to what I was expecting to see, where they Year 2020 takes a large dropoff in average spending on EveningOut.\nConclusion: All in all, the questions I answered were (1) The percent of people celebrating Valentine’s Day throughout the years has decreased, (2) the trend in average spending per person per year has gone up per reasons mentioned with the plot, and (3) after noting the results of (2), the average spending in EveningOut dropped off in 2020, right where I expected it to. Flaws in my approach o analyzing the data I selected come with the fact that the data I chose was more for fun and less for finding actual facts, so it’s not very useful, but it is fun to explore in the way I did. If I had additional data and some more time, I would explore the changes in spending on each of different variables associated to different gifts, and I would be interested to see an average spending variable by region so see the spending distribution across the United States as well.\nMy visualizations are an effective way of communicating because the colors used are appropriate to what I am exploring, they are easy to perceive and aren’t too much, and the line plots are really beneficial when showing change through time because it makes a cohesive visualization."

    "text": "Introduction: The data set I’m working with is data collected from the show Hot One’s, where typically a celebrity contestant goes into an informal sit down interview and as they’re being interviewed they have a wing they need to eat. With each round of questioning the sauce on the wing gets hotter until the last sauce, which is extremely hot, all while still answering questions.\nThe variables I’m most interested in are sauce_name and scoville, but also separately guest and finished.\nsauce_name - Type of Hot sauce used from 1-10, with each number representing a different brand of hot sauce\nscoville - number representing how hot the sauce is based on the Scoville Scale, with values ranging from Mild (0 - 2,500), Medium (2,500 to 30,000), Hot (30,000 to 100,000), Extra Hot (100,000 to 300,000) and Extremely Hot (above 300,000)\nguest - name of the celebrity guest\nfinished - whether the guest finished all 10 wings or not\nThe question I will be exploring is do the super hot sauces affect a guests ability to finish all 10 wings? How many guests were able to finish and what can we see about the different sauces?\nI got the data from the tidytuesday repository on github at this link : https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nepisodes &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-08-08/episodes.csv')\nsauces &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-08-08/sauces.csv')\n\nhot_ones &lt;- full_join(sauces, episodes) \n\nFirst, I’d like to explore the proportion of guests who were able to finish all 10 wings by finding the count of TRUE’s in the finished variable and seeing it in a table.\n\nlibrary(pander)\n\nhot_ones |&gt; \n  mutate(count = case_when(finished == \"TRUE\" ~ 1,\n                           finished == \"FALSE\" ~ 0)) |&gt;\n  select(finished, count, guest) |&gt;\n  mutate(total_finish = sum(count)) |&gt;\n  group_by(count) |&gt;\n  summarize(n()) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  mutate(prop_finished = 2850/ (2850 + 150)) |&gt;\n  mutate(prop_unfinished = 150 / (2850+150)) |&gt;\n  mutate(count = case_when(count == 0 ~ \"No\",\n                           count == 1 ~ \"Yes\")) |&gt;\n  select(prop_finished, prop_unfinished) |&gt;\n  slice(2) |&gt;\n  pander()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprop_finished\nprop_unfinished\n\n\n\n\n0.95\n0.05\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, I will be looking at the name of the sauce and scoville level only for season 1 to gauge the difference in spice between each wing. To do this I will start off with a bar plot showing the difference between spice levels.\n\nseason_1_sauce &lt;- sauces |&gt; slice(1:10) |&gt;\n  mutate(sauce_name = fct_reorder(sauce_name, scoville))\n\nggplot(data = season_1_sauce, aes(x = sauce_name, y = scoville)) +\n  geom_col(color = \"darkblue\", fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFrom this visualization, we can see that the sauces don’t equally go up in spice as the number of wings progresses to 10, but there is more of an exponential growth once we reach somewhere around the 7th sauce.\nThese two findings are interesting to compare, showing a majority of the contestants were able to finish with a .95 proportion of TRUE’s within the finished variable. Not shown in my visualizations, but within the data the spiciness for each sauce per season actually goes up to getting progressively hotter sauces per season. To dive further into this comparison and with more time, I would go through each season and see if the proportion of finishing decreases increase or stays the same keeping in mind that the sauces have gotten hotter in more recent seasons, and possibly make the same bar plot I made above for each season and compare the increasing nature of scoville between the new hot sauces.\nThese visuals are effective ways to communicate information because the table shows calculated proportions I did which just comes simply down to equations which you can see in the code. The plot effectively shows the level of spiciness between sauces, and the descending nature of the bars makes it easy to see trends between sauces."

    "title": "Central Park Squirrels",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction: The data set I’m working with is from the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Consensus, which is a multimedia science, design, and storytelling project. They count squirrels and present their findings to the public. The dataset contains squirrel data for each of the 3,023 sightings, including location coordinates, age, primary and secondary fur color, elevation, activities, communications, and interactions between squirrels and with humans. I pulled this data set and information about it from the TidyTuesday github repository. Something important to note about this data is that some of the squirrels contain NA values for important variables like Age and Fur Color, so this isn’t an entirely accurate colection and there are some unnamed data points being left out.\nThe variables I’m most interested in are:\nAge: Age of squirrel, value is either “Adult” or “Juvenile.”\nPrimary Fur Color: Main color of their fur; value is either “Gray,” “Cinnamon” or “Black.”\nShift: Value is either “AM” or “PM” to communicate whether or not the sighting session occurred in the morning or late afternoon.\nThe questions I will be answering are:\n\nWhat is the most popular squirrel color?\nWhat is the most popular color in adult and juvenile age groups respectively?\nDo adults or juveniles prefer pm over am?\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nsquirrel &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-23/squirrel_data.csv')\n\n#To replace NA and \"?\" values with Unknown for the Age and Primary Fur Color variables to make the plots look cleaner\nsquirrel &lt;- squirrel |&gt;\n  mutate(`Primary Fur Color` = if_else(is.na(`Primary Fur Color`), true = \"Unknown\", false = `Primary Fur Color`),\n         Age = if_else(is.na(Age) | Age == \"?\", true = \"Unknown\", false = Age))\n\n\nggplot(data = squirrel, aes(x = `Primary Fur Color`)) +\n  geom_bar(colour = \"brown4\", fill = \"grey\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Primary Fur Color\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at this graph, we can denote that the most popular Primary Fur Color in squirrels recorded in this study is gray by a good amount (almost 2000 more squirrels are Gray than the next most popular). Cinnamon is a far second with black being a small sliver of squirrels. The unknown variable represents squirrels collected without a distinct Primary Fur Color.\n\nggplot(squirrel, aes(x = Age, fill = `Primary Fur Color`)) +\n  geom_bar(data = squirrel, position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Primary Fur Color by Age\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nBy looking at this plot of Primary Fur Color by Age, we see that the distribution of fur color stays similar to the first plot I made with gray coming out on top again with Cinnamon and others far behind. Something interesting we can note without purposely seeking it out is we now see that a majority of squirrels that were recorded are Adults.\n\nggplot(squirrel, aes(x = Age, fill = Shift)) +\n  geom_bar(data = squirrel, position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Shift by Age\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nNow in this plot, we have added Shift to the conversation, looking at the sightings of squirrels by age and what time of day they were recorded. As we see, most squirrels recorded were seen during the pm, but it isn’t as drastic a difference between counts for Shift than seen in previous comparisons.\nConclusion: From the visualizations above, we can confidently conclude that after removing unidentified squirrels from the data, a typical squirrel in central park in 2018 will be a Gray Adult squirrel who is most active in the PM.\nSome flaws within the data and things I wish I had more specifics on are what were teh exact time frames that squirrels were being observed. I ask this because if a majority of squirrel observation was happening in the pm, this would obviouslt give the result we see with pm being more popular for both age groups. Another thing I wish I thought about more before using this data set is that it is mostly categorical variables, so there wasn’t much I could do in terms of the usual visualizations I make.\nFuture directions I would go with more data/time is exploring the variables I didn’t get to look at like the different sounds the squirrels could’ve possibly be making, or what actiity they were doing when observed under variables like running, chasing, eating, climbing foraging etc.\nMy visuals are an effective way of communicating because they are clutter free, very straight forward and use color friendly scales."
